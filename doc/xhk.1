xhk \- HalfKey Xorg Driver Utility
.SH SYNOPSIS

| \f[B]\-dd\f[R] | \f[B]\-ddd\f[R]] [\f[B]\-h\f[R]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f[B]xHK\f[R] is a half keyboard mirroring implementation to help
one\-handed typist.
.PP
Running xhk detaches the keyboard, and intercepts all input; processing
it for space bar pushes as it goes.
The space bar acts as a modifier if it is held at the same time as a
standard letter.
Modifying acts to mirror the input such that key presses are mirrored
down the middle of the home row.
Pressing space, and then releasing will still provide a single space
character.
.PP
The keyboard device should be guessed at launch, but if that fails, the
\f[B]\-i\f[R] flag can be used to manually select the correct device.
